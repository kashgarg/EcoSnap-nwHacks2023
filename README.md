## **What is EcoSnap?**
EcoSnap assesses an individual's carbon footprint through a series of multiple choice questions. The program then generates a proxy for the user's carbon footprint and compares it to the average carbon footprint of a person. This allows users to gain insight into their own environmental impact and make changes to reduce their carbon footprint.

## **Who is EcoSnap for?**
EcoSnap is for individuals who are interested in understanding their carbon footprint and taking steps to reduce it. It is also useful for educators and organizations who are looking to raise awareness about environmental sustainability. EcoSnap is designed to be accessible to a wide range of users, regardless of their prior knowledge of the subject.

## **Why did we make EcoSnap?**
EcoSnap was created to raise awareness about the importance of reducing carbon footprint and to help individuals understand their personal impact on the environment. The goal is to provide a simple and interactive tool that allows users to easily calculate and understand their carbon footprint, and to make informed decisions about how to reduce it. The hope is that EcoSnap will empower individuals to take action and contribute to the global effort to mitigate the effects of climate change.
